Task
=======

Using JavaScript, but not using platforms like jQuery, Backbone, Knockout, and the like, write a simple program to find the solution to the tr iangle peg game (see http://www.joenord.com/puzzles/peggame/ for the game rules and one solution). Itâ€™s less important what solution it finds, as long as the program is written simply, generically, and works recursively to find any solution that leaves one pin in the game. You can then just use alert to show the list of moves in the solution.
